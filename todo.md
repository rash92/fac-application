TODO:
- create game, host it separately and link to it externally on homepage.
- write all the text and make text pretty/ pick font etc.
- add second image per project? (one for button, one in contents)
- mess about with colour palette?
- explain projects that open in new tabs
        - bomberman: only html, css and js but not solo made by me
        - snake and flappy fish: following tutorial
            snake: bug - mushroom sometimes out of bounds
            flappy fish: no instructions
        - social network: link to github with brief description
        - todo: explain that it's using my custom framework made following tutorials that reimplements basic react features
        - have a tab per project with brief description + link + own background
        - maybe small image drops and rolls when clicked? (bomb, fish, snake, pen/ pad?)
        - talk about AI stuff - aisafety camp brief description, playing around with image gen with stability matrix brief description, anthropic papers i've enjoyed/ neel nanda.
        - other projects: grav lensing project in matlab, helping with a friend's c# project (testing a bit, and setting up github actions automation)

    - explain background/ brief cv outline?
    - explain why i want to work in webdev

    -structure:
        about (paragraph), some kind of picture?
        tutoring: paragraph
        languages summary: links that jump to projects below maybe?
        completed games: tabs -> application game, snake, flappy fish, bomberman
        other completed 01F projects (github): tabs -> miniframework, social network,
        misc projects (no github/ minor contributions/ unfinished): tabs -> cs_ff, physics project, ai safety camp, rpg-character creator

    - navbar - jump to links instead of separate links? e.g. games, other projects, then external links to github and linked in maybe

game:
    dice game (yahtzee) with powerups?
    card game (blackjack) with powerups?
    could do without powerups and just have basic game
    chess?
    SIMPLE: don't be overambitious, only have 1 month.

css/ styling:

    - animations as you select tabs?
    - images before/ after text instead of as background to it? makes it too hard to read as background maybe.
