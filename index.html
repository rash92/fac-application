            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                My name is Rashid, I did some programming in MATLAB during my degree, but I began seriously trying to learn to code when i joined a part time peer to peer program at 01Founders a few years ago. I have made various projects both in groups and by myself in Go and Javascript. I have mostly worked on the backend on projects so far and would like to continue to improve my skills there as well as learn how to do frontend work so I can be a more well-rounded web dev. I found I enjoy the puzzle solving and creative aspects when it comes to the projects I've worked on so far and I enjoy working collaboratively with others by teaching what i've learned and learning about other approaches from others. I find my experience with tutoring has been helpful with this.
            </div>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I did physics etc. etc.</p>
            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p>While at university I began tutoring and found I enjoy it, and continued this afterwards. I still tutor part time while i try to break into the world of tech. I do maths and physics tutoring hence i am good at communicating and explain technical topics etc. etc. etc.</p>
            <h2>Learning to code</h2>
            <h3>01Founders</h3>
            <p>I joined 01Founders where etc. etc.</p>
            <h3>Online resources</h3>
            <p>I have also done some studying using online courses, particularly appacademy, kaggle learn, and various youtube channels including franks lab for learning object oriented javascript and 3blue1brown for foundational knowledge about how machine learnign works</p>
            <h3>AI Safety Camp</h3>
            <p>Last year I joined a program called AI Safety Camp. It involved volunteering for 3 months to join a research team consisting of an experienced researcher and several junior team members who wanted to learn while assisting in completing a piece of research. The particular project I joined was in the 'mechanistic interpretability' category, and involved joining a mature python codebase where I had to familiarize myself with how things currently worked, edit existing functions and create new ones in order to measure and visualize the effects of pruning neurons on performance in various areas. For example, we would deliberately prune neurons that made performance on maths questions worse, and see how much performance dropped in physics, biology, chemistry, code, law etc.</p>
            <h2>Languages and Technologies</h2>
            <p>here are some of the topics I have experience working with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go</li>
                <li>Javascript (Vanilla and React)</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>python</li>
                <li>MATLAB</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Areas I would like to improve on</h2>
            <p>Some areas I would like to improve on and that I hope joining Founders and Coders will help with include working with cloud tools, getting better at testing (especially end to end and integration testing), and improving my frontend skills</p>

                    <p>This was a group project to create a social network with posts, comments, groups, events, private and group messages, followers, notifications and other features.

                    <p>It is not currently hosted so to see it you would have to clone the repo and run it locally. here is the link to the <a href="https://github.com/rash92/01f-social-network">code</a>.</p>

                    <p>This was my final project during my Physics masters. It involved ingesting a large dataset of galaxies and using ray traving to simulate the path of light from galaxies to an observer, taking into account how light was bent by other galaxies on the path there. It was written in MATLAB</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately I no longer have the code available</p>

                    <p>I volunteered for 3 months on 'AI Safety Camp' as a junior research engineer. I joined along with some other volunteers to help a team leader with his existing project written in python to analyise an LLM (specifically Llama), by pruning neurons to reduce performance on specific topics and checking to see how performance in other topics fell. E.g. as performance on answering biology related questions was deliberately stunted, how much did performance fall in chemistry vs. physics vs. maths vs. english vs. law etc. </p>
