        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            My name is Rashid, I did some programming in MATLAB during my degree, but I began seriously trying to learn to code when i joined a part time peer to peer program at 01Founders a few years ago. I have made various projects both in groups and by myself in Go and Javascript. I have mostly worked on the backend on projects so far and would like to continue to improve my skills there as well as learn how to do frontend work so I can be a more well-rounded web dev. I found I enjoy the puzzle solving and creative aspects when it comes to the projects I've worked on so far and I enjoy working collaboratively with others by teaching what i've learned and learning about other approaches from others. I find my experience with tutoring has been helpful with this.
        </div>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div>
            On the top of the screen you should see some projects i've worked on as well as a link to my github and linked in. There is the game i made specifically for this application following the requirements, but i have also included some games i'd made previously as well as a project i did where i attempted to recreate a mini version of React.
            <h3>Bomberman</h3>
            <div>This is a project I created using only HTML, CSS and javascript. I made this with a team of two others from 01Founders, and the idea was mostly to recreate the classic game bomberman.</div>
            <h3>Flappy Fish</h3>
            <div>This is a game I made with html, css and javascript following a tutorial. The controls are click to go up and shift to boost. the bar on the left shows how much boost energy you have left.</div>
            <h3>Multiplayer Snake</h3>
            <div>This is another game i made following a tutorial. You can have two players playing on the same keyboard, one with the WASD keys and one with the arrow keys. There is currently a bug where the mushroom you eat sometimes spawns out of bounds and softlocks you.</div>
            <h3>To do list</h3>
            <div>This is a project I made where I tried to recreate the basics of react in a mini framework, and then use that mini framework to create a basic todo list that had all of the features of the 'todoMVC' todo lists. I used a tutorial to help me understand how react works under the hood as i made the mini framework.</div>
