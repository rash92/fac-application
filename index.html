        <h2>My Jounrey into programming</h2>
        <p>
          I did some programming in MATLAB during my degree, where I was
          studying physics, but I began seriously trying to learn to code when i
          joined a part time peer to peer program at 01Founders a few years ago,
          after deciding I needed a more stable career with room to grow during
          the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made various projects both in groups and by myself in Go and
          Javascript. I have mostly worked on the backend on projects so far and
          would like to continue to improve my skills there as well as learn how
          to do frontend work so I can be a more well-rounded web dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found I enjoy the puzzle solving and creative aspects when it comes
          to the projects I've worked on so far and I enjoy working
          collaboratively with others by teaching what i've learned and learning
          about other approaches from others.
        </p>
        <h2>Tutoring</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/tutoring_background.jpg"
          alt="cartoon drawing of various school supplies. a notebook, a compass, a pencil, a set square and a calculator."
        />
        <p>
          While at university I began tutoring and I have tutored mathematics
          and physics upto A level in groups and 1-to-1, both for other
          companies and as a self employed private tutor. I'm still tutoring
          part time while I try to study and break into the world of tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the satisfaction of helping people improve their confidence
          and finally get their head around something they've been struggling to
          understand. The 'AHA!' moment when something finally clicks is
          exhillerating, and being able to help give those moments to others is
          my favourite part of tutoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tutoring experience has improved my communication skills and my
          ability to explain technical topics in a way tailored to different
          audiences with different levels of experience and knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning to code</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/aicamp_background.png"
          alt="A finger touching some colorful squares in a grid pattern, the squares are linked to rows of squares behind them which are on a backdrop of random letters. Abstract representation of code."
        />
        <h3>01Founders</h3>
        <p>
          I have been studying part time at 01Founders for the last few years,
          which is a peer to peer coding course.
        </p>
        <p>
          It involves completing various projects, some solo but mostly in
          groups, where we are given a project outline and requirements and then
          decide for ourselves how and what we need to learn to accomplish it,
          and deciding for ourselves how to design and implement the program to
          meet the requirements given without help from any teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has greatly improved my ability to work collaboratively, figuring
          out how to distribute workloads and make sure everyone is on the same
          page, working with git and dealing with merging code.
        </p>
        <h3>Online resources</h3>
        <p>
          I have also done some studying using online courses, particularly
          appacademy, kaggle learn, and various youtube channels including
          Franks Lab which was my introduction to object oriented javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also greatly enjoyed 3blue1brown for learning the fundamentals
          about how machine learnign works as well as many other topics, and
          I've also watched various other programming related youtubers like The
          Primeagen and LowLevelLearning.
        </p>
        <h2>Areas I would like to improve on</h2>
        <img
          src="/images/github_actions_background.png"
          alt="the github logo and a github actions logo, representing the concept of automated testing and DevOps."
        />
        <p>
          Some areas I would like to improve on and that I hope joining Founders
          and Coders will help with include working with cloud tools and DevOps
          more generally, getting better at testing (especially end to end and
          integration testing), and improving my frontend skills.

              This is the game i made for the application. It's an
              implementation of yahtzee.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's the first project I've made trying to do it in the object
              oriented style where I wasn't following a tutorial. Initially I
              considered using canvas the way I did for the snake and flappy
              fish games before realizing that I didn't actually need read time
              updating for this project as things only change based on user
              input.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's still room to improve in terms of styling and animations,
              and some ideas for extensions I had include power ups partway
              through (e.g. being able to boost your dice, getting extra dice,
              having special dice with different faces like only odd, only even,
              or extra sixes) but i didn't have time to implement them.

              This project involved recreating behavious from the React
              framework and then using that framework to create a basic to do
              list that has all of the features on the to-do lists on todoMVC. I
              followed this excellent
              <a href="https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/">tutorial</a> by

              This was a group project to create a social network with posts,

              notifications and other features. It was build with a go backend
              using SQLite as the database and React for the frontend. My
              contribution was mainly on the backend working with Go and SQLite.

              simulate the path of light from galaxies to an observer, taking
              into account how light was bent by other galaxies on the path
              there. It was written in MATLAB.

            <p>
              Last year I joined a program called AI Safety Camp. It involved
              volunteering for 3 months to join a research team consisting of an
              experienced researcher and several junior team members who wanted
              to learn while assisting in completing a piece of research.
            </p>
            <p>
              The particular project I joined was in the 'mechanistic
              interpretability' category, and involved joining a mature python
              codebase where I had to familiarize myself with how things
              currently worked, edit existing functions and create new ones in
              order to measure and visualize the effects of pruning neurons on
              performance in various areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, we would deliberately prune neurons that made
              performance on maths questions worse, and see how much performance
              dropped in physics, biology, chemistry, code, law etc.

              from the time, although I only worked on a small part of it.
